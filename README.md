Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React 
- Axios (or Fetch API) for HTTP requests
- JSONPlaceholder for the mock backend API

## Challenges and Future Improvements

During the development process, some challenges I faced was to include:

- The Edit feature, which retrieves the original state. After the edit has been performed, pass the updated state back to the parent component.
- Ensuring error handling for API requests.

## Given more time : 

- If I had more time, I could integrate a MongoDB database so that the website could function as a real-world application.
- Also as per requirement we can also implement user authentication and authorization for added security.
- In a real-world application, there would typically be a large number of users in the database, so it would be beneficial to implement search and filter functionality to easily locate specific user details
